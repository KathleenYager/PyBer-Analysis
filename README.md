# PyBer-Analysis
## Overview
PyBer is a ride-share company that serves indiviudals in three geographic area types: urban, suburban and rural. The company requested analysis be completed on the total weekly fares by each city type to determine how the differences can be used in decision-making. 

## Results
Data used for the project reflects fares collected by drivers in three city types between Janaury and April, 2019. The data reflects cities in urban settings produce higher weekly fares than do cities in suburban and rural areas. Weekly fares collected in urban cities per week during this time period can be 10 times greater than in rural areas and 3 times greater than in suburban areas. 

Volume of rides impacts the average amount per ride, with urban setting fares producing two thirds of the profits. The appears to be a result of a higher number of drivers providing rides in urban settings than in the other two types of cities. The average cost of rides substantially increased based on the number of rides provided per driver. Rural settings have the lowest number of drivers producing the lowest number of rides and have the highest average rates per ride at approximately $10 more than an average ride costs in an urban settings. 

Drivers in rural settings charge more than three times the rate of urban drivers and produce just over 10% of the revenue as there urban counterparts. Drivers in suburan areas provide rides in greater volume than drivers in rural areas thereby producing greater revenue than their rural counterparts, but fall short of matching revenue produced in urban cities by approximately 50%.  

The data reflects that there are signifcantly more drivers in urban settings than in rural and suburban settings and taht volume of drivers and rides heavily impacts revenu despite the average fare being less in urban settings. Because of this, PyBer may want to continue to focus efforts in urban settings, while determining how it can, or if it needs to better serve rural and suburban communities. 

The graph below provides an overview of fares collected in U.S. dollars for each city type between January and April 2019. The graph highlights the difference in revenues collected per city type.

## Summary
In summary, the results of the data indicate that PyBer experiences disparities in average fare rates between city types. Differnces seem to be based on volume of rides provided by city type. PyBer executives may consider some of the following to mitigate the disparities. 
    - Elevating the rates in urban settings to offset rates in rural and suburban areas thereby allowing rate reductions in rural and suburban communities. 
    - Conduct a needs assessment for services in rural and suburban settings to determine the need for additional drivers. Increasing the volume of drivers and rides in rural and suburban cities has the potential to increase revenue produced while lowering the cost of rides in these communities. 

Both options may increase revenue while adding benefit to each city type. Exploration of expansion may mitigate a commopn challenge experienced by people living in rural and urban communities, a lack of adequate and affordable transporation. PyBer may have the opportunity to increase revenue and offer greater support to each community type it serves.
